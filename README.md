# Top User Server List
``yaml
 - Addon name: Top User & Server List
 - GitHub link: https://github.com/CaffeJappa/Top-User-Server-List
 - Brief description: A simple Discord theme that moves your userbar and server list to the top of Discord. Based on Gibbu's Horizontal Server List and Name-Panel by LeePrky with changes in their code.
 - Did you make this addon yourself? Yes. I had to adapt HSL and Name-Panel to work together, and also change some of the original Name-Panel code.
 - Are you using pieces of other people's code? Yes. I'm using HSL (changed code to work together with Name-Panel) code and Name-Panel (changed code so it works in normal discord) code.
